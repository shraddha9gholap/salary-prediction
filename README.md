# Employee Salary Prediction in Machine learning 
In this project we are going to predict the salary of employee using machine learning algorithm.
This model predicts the salary of the employee based on the year of experience of employee.
This is a regression problem which is solved using a Linear Regression.

Steps used in this project for implementing this model in this project.

1. Import all required libraries 
2. Load data 
3. Perform EDA 
4. Visualize data 
5. Prepare data 
6. Split data into training and testing  
7. Define model 
8. Test model 
9.  Check accuracy
10. Save the model 

I used the Linear Regression model which gives me a  97% accuracy on the testing data.
