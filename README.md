# Employee Salary Prediction in Machine learning 

In this project we are going to predict the salary of empolyee using machine learning algorithm.
This model predicts the salary of the employee based on the year of experience of employee.
This is a regression problem which is solved using a **LinearRegression.**

steps used in this project for implementing this model in this project .

1.Import all required libraries 
2.load data 
3.perform EDA 
4.visualize data 
5.prepare data 
6.split data into training and testing  
7.define model 
8.test model 
9.check accuracy
10.save the model 

I used the LinearRegression model which gives me a 97% accuracy on the testing data.

**required libraries :**
1. Pandas 
2. Numpy
3. matplotlib 
4. sklearn
